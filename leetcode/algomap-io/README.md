# DSA Roadmap Progress - Based on AlgoMap

This repository tracks my personal progress through the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) roadmap** provided by [AlgoMap.io](https://algomap.io/roadmap).

## About this project

The goal of this project is to strengthen my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of core computer science concepts. The roadmap is structured to help prepare for technical interviews by focusing on essential algorithmic patterns and data structures.

## What is the AlgoMap roadmap?

The AlgoMap roadmap offers a curated list of LeetCode-style problems grouped by topic, including:

- Arrays & Strings  
- Hashmaps & Sets  
- Two Pointers  
- Stacks & Queues  
- Linked Lists  
- Binary Search  
- Sliding Window  
- Trees  
- Heaps & Priority Queues  
- Recursive Backtracking  
- Graphs  
- Dynamic Programming  

Each section includes problems with increasing levels of difficulty, designed to build a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures.

## Repository structure

This repository is organized by topic. Each folder contains:

- Solutions to the problems (written in Python or another language)
- Explanations and personal notes
- Key takeaways or challenges encountered

## Purpose

- Build a solid foundation in DSA
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Track and document my learning journey
- Share solutions and insights with others
